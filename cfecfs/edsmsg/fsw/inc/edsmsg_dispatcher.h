**
** Purpose:
**      API for the Electronic Data Sheets (EDS) for software bus messages
**
**      Contains prototypes for the generic pack, unpack, and dispatch routines
**      that are part of the Software Bus (SB) application.  These are the EDS
**      API calls that actually work with instances of message objects, which
**      are all some form of CCSDS_SpacePacket_t (the base type of all SB messages).
**
**      This is a separate header file as these API calls are only available in
**      an EDS-enabled build.
**
**  Note - this public header file does not include any "EdsLib" headers directly...
**  The SB EDS implementation abstracts the relevant EdsLib data types so that
**  CFS applications are only dealing with the SB API directly, not going directly to
**  EdsLib to perform data operations.  This keeps the include paths simpler and
**  eases migration.

/**
 * \brief Dispatch an incoming message to its handler function, given a dispatch table.
 *
 * The incoming message will be identified and matched against the given
 * EDS-defined interface.
 *
 * If the message payload is defined by the application's EDS, the correct
 * handler function in the dispatch table will be called.
 *
 * \note this function is generally not directly invoked from applications, it
 * should be invoked through a wrapper generated from the EDS tool.  The wrapper
 * has a simpler API and ensures that the ID values passed in are correct.
 *
 * \param DeclIntfId    The declared interface ID from EDS
 * \param ComponentId   The component ID from EDS
 * \param Buffer        Pointer to the Software Bus buffer (with headers)
 * \param DispatchTable Pointer to the dispatch table
 * \returns If successfully dispatched, returns code from handler function, otherwise an error code.
