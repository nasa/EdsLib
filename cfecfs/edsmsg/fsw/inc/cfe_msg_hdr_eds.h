/**
 * \brief Convert from a CFE_MSG_TelemetryHeader_t or CFE_MSG_CommandHeader_t to a CFE_MSG_Message_t
 *
 * \par Description
 *       Given a pointer to a secondary header structure, return a pointer
 *       to the CFE_MSG_Message_t (base header/primary header) object.
 *
 * \par Notes
 *       Implemented as a macro, so it should work with both Command and Telemetry headers.
 *
 *       In the EDS version it goes through a "void*" type, so as to not trigger alias warnings, however
 *       all MSG-related structs must all begin with an actual instance of CFE_HDR_Message_t for
 *       this to be valid/safe.  All EDS-generated message structures meet this requirement because
 *       they all (eventually) derive from this base type, but any hand-written struct could be incorrect,
 *       and unfortunately will not trigger an error when using void* cast.
