 * Defines the basic structures and enumerated data types for interaction with
 * the EDS runtime library.  This file contains common definitions that are shared
 * between the generated database sources and the runtime software library.
 *
 * Some structure types defined here are abstract objects; user application code
 * may only deal with _pointers_ to these objects, which must not be modified
 * or otherwise accessed directly by the user application.   The EDS library
 * defines public API calls to interpret these objects and get meaningful data
 * out of them.
 *
 * In addition to the structure types, this file defines several enumerations
 * that are shared between the generated code and the runtime code.  This file should
 * contain any definition that is intended to be globally defined throughout both
 * the runtime public API as well as in the generated sources.
